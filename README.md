Commands:
/earth command and moon gravity by Javipepe. This plugin will let you go to the moon and come back, featuring random terrain generation, craters and flags!

`/moon` - Will generate (if world isn't already there) a moon and teleport you to it (if you aren't already). Also you will get a cool jump boost effect!

`/earth` - Gbye to moon! Will teleport you to the world you were at when you executed `/moon` and you'll lose them cool jump effects. It was a cool trip, though!
