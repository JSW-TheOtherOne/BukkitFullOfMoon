# BukkitFullOfMoon
Custom generator example for Bukkit. Originally done by Dinnerbone; 1.7+ compatibility, /earth command and moon gravity by Javipepe. This plugin will let you go to the moon and come back, featuring random terrain generation, craters and flags!

Commands:

`/moon` - Will generate (if world isn't already there) a moon and teleport you to it (if you aren't already). Also you will get a cool jump boost effect!

`/earth` - Gbye to moon! Will teleport you to the world you were at when you executed `/moon` and you'll lose them cool jump effects. It was a cool trip, though!

How to build:

From terminal do: `git clone https://github.com/javipepe/BukkitFullOfMoon.git`, then `cd BukkitFullOfMoon` and lastly to build it, `mvn clean install`. The .jar will be found at `BukkitFullOfMoon/target/`.

Have fun! Also beware, monsters spawn there too, so ready up your amoonition :wink: !
